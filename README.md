## About
The whole code is basically just in the file `JinoDiaryApp/ContentView.swift` (also you need `JinoDiaryApp/JinoDiaryAppApp.swift`).

But I also have icons in this project, for the macOS app.

If you can run that, you're good to go. I do it using Xcode.

This "daily diary" app is just a personal tool I use, because it helps me with work. If you want to use it too, use at your own discretion.

## Screenshot
The app looks like this as of writing this (I'll try to update with a new screenshot as time goes on and there's new development):
