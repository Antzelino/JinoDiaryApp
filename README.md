The whole code is basically just in the file `JinoDiaryApp/ContentView.swift` (also you need `JinoDiaryApp/JinoDiaryAppApp.swift`).

But I also have icons in this project, for the macOS app. If you can run that, you're good to go.

I do it using Xcode.

This "daily diary" app is just a personal tool I use, because it help me with work. If you want to use it too, use at your own discretion.
